 JNavigator
 ----

 JNavigator is an autopilot software, suitable for the needs of the JAviator
helicopter. At start of autonomous flights, JNavigator divides set course
trajectories, which are paths of waypoints, in segments of constant velocity or
constant acceleration. In consideration of flight time, JNavigator determines
the JAviator's nominal position and tries to stir the helicopter towards it by
regarding its current position, which is provided by a GPS receiver.
